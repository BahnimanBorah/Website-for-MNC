# Website-for-MNC
Web Development Project. This repository contains the source files for a website project I made.

I made this project as a web development project that focuses on working with Cascading Style Sheets for making more attractive
web pages. This project also focuses on working with PHP and PHPMyAdmin database. Website containes an ERP portal for employees and admins
to manage their work. CSS uses icons and image styling.
